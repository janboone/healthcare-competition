* Introduction

** The story

  - when the health care system is based on markets, 2 recurring policy
    questions:

    - is there a tendency to treat too many patients?
    - are there enough incentives to invest in quality?

  - we focus here on non-contractible quality
  - providers invest in quality to attract patients, but then treating patients
    should be profitable
  - if treating patients is profitable, over-treatment becomes a risk
  - Question: how is this trade off affected by provider and insurer competition?


** Motivation

    - The Netherlands introduced competition in health care markets 10 years ago
    - three different markets:

        - health insurance market
        - health provider market
        - health procurement market

    - tractable way to model these markets and characterize treatment quantity
      and quality

** Which imperfections?

    - a lot of imperfections in health care/insurance markets
    - here interested in the interaction of the health procurement and provider markets
    - important imperfections here:

        - insurer cannot contract on value of treatment: over/under supply
        - insurer cannot contract on quality: too low/too high; non-excludable
        - patient may know more about quality than insurer

    - let's not worry about

        - adverse selection
        - patient moral hazard
        - health insurance uptake/deadweight loss (inelastic demand)


** The intuition

    - fee-for-service affects treatment decisions and provider rents
    - capitation fees redistribute rents between insurers and providers
    - provider competition tends to

        - increase (non-contractable) quality investments

    - insurer competition tends to

        - raise treatments (over-supply)
        - reduce effort investments (appropriability)


** Results

    - "monopoly": consumer chooses without regard for value created
    - provider "monopoly" leads to zero quality investments
    - insurer "monopoly" allows insurer to capture return on quality investments
    - starting from provider and insurer "monopoly", an increase in competition
      on each market is welfare enhancing

** Simplify a lot

   - two insurers and two providers
   - contracts are public and non-discriminating
   - focus on symmetric equilibria
   - no exclusive contracts


** Literature

   - Porter and Teisberg (2006)
   - Gaynor et al. (2015)
   - Gal-Or (1997, 1999)
   - Douven et al. (2014)
   - Bijlsma et al. (2015)

* Model

** Set up

    - 2 insurers $I_{a,b}$, 2 providers $P_{1,2}$
    - 1 patient; needs treatment with prob. $\phi =1$
    - patient is of type $v \geq 0$, distribution $F$
    - expected value of treatment at $P_j$: $\int_0^{v_j} (e_j+v)f(v)dv$
    - cost of treatment $c(v)$
    - fixed effort cost of quality $\gamma(e)$
    - $c(.),\gamma(.)$ are increasing and convex

** First best

    - allowing the patient provider choice, social planner maximizes:
    - $W = \int_0^v (\tilde v + e-c(\tilde v)) f(\tilde v) d \tilde v - 2 \gamma(e)$
    - treatment volume $v$ and quality $e$:

\begin{align}
\label{eq:1}
f(v^{*})(v^{*}+e^{*} - c(v^{*})) &=0 \\
\label{eq:2}
F(v^{*}) - 2 \gamma' (e^{*}) &=0
\end{align}

** Market

    - insurers offer providers contracts $(p,T)$
    - two-part tariff: fee-for-service and capitation
    - neither $v$ nor $e$ are contractable
    - public non-discriminatory offers
    - focus on symmetric equilibrium

** Timing

    - health procurement market

        - insurers offer $p,T$
        - providers accept/reject, pay $T$ to insurer
        - providers invest $e_j$

    - health insurance market

        - prob. $\theta_I$, there is Hotelling compet.; $1-\theta_I$ consumer chooses
          insurer indep. from value offered
        - insurer sets premium $\sigma$; no co-payments
        - consumer decides from which insurer to buy

    - health provider market

        - prob. $1-\theta_P$ and $\theta_P$
        - Hotelling competition in efforts (if consumer has choice)
        - provider decides whether or not to treat
        - if patient is treated, provider receives $p$


** Provider rents

    - treat patient $v$ if $p \geq c(v)$
    - earn rents over infra-marginal patients
    - these rents give the incentive to compete for patients by investing $e$
    - in symmetric equilibrium: $\gamma'(e) =  \frac{\theta_P}{2t_P} R(v) F(v)$
    - higher $p$ leads to higher $v$ and hence $e$

** Insurers

    - insurers use $T$ to capture rents: $\gamma_e$ affects $\Pi_a$
    - $I_a$ sets $v_a$ to solve:
    - $\frac{d\Pi_a}{d v_a} = \frac{\partial \Pi_a}{\partial v_a} + \frac{\partial \Pi_a}{\partial e_a} \frac{de}{dv_a} =0$

*** treatment volume

    - $\frac{\partial \Pi_a}{\partial v_{a}} = f(v_a) \left[ (e+v_a-c(v_a)) (\frac{\theta_I}{3} + \frac{1-\theta_I}{2}) + \frac{\theta_I}{6}  c'(v_a) \frac{F(v_a)}{f(v_a)}  \right]$
    - if effort contractible:

        - $\theta_I =0$ implies first best: $e+v_a-c(v_a)=0$
        - $\theta_I >0$ implies over-treatment: $e+v_a-c(v_a)<0$

    - "monopolist" captures whole insurance surplus and induces efficient
      treatment
    - competition tends to increase "production"
    - inefficiently high production:

        - insurer price competition: upward sloping reaction functions
        - increasing your cost $p$, increases your premium $\sigma$
        - with upward sloping reaction functions, this raises your opponent's
          premium
        - this benefit of raising $p$ is absent for monopolist

*** treatment quality

    - $\frac{\partial \Pi_a}{\partial e} =  \frac{1}{2} (1-\theta_I)F(v_{a}) - 2 \gamma'(e)$
    - if effort contractible, non-excludability implies:

        - $\theta_I =0$ implies lower quality than first best due to positive
          spillovers on other insurer
        - $\theta_I =1$ implies no quality investment as insurer cannot
          appropriate value of quality increase
        - quality does not create a difference between insurers

*** non-contractible quality

    - trade off between $\frac{\partial \Pi_a}{\partial v_a}$ and
      $\frac{\partial \Pi_a}{\partial e_a}$

        - either over-treatment with under-investment in quality
        - or under-treatment with over-investment


** Competition

    - suppose we have $\theta^*_{P,I}$ such that we are in first best

        - then a reduction in $R^*$ requires:
        - more intense provider competition (to keep up $e$)
        - more intense insurer competition to balance incentives for
          over-treatment and under-investment

    - suppose we have over-treatment and under-investment, then (under some conditions):

        - increase in $\theta_P$ increases welfare: quality becomes more
          responsive to volume
        - decrease in $\theta_I$ increases welfare: reduces volume

* Conclusion

** Policy implications

    - think of provider rents as caused by asymmetric information
    - provider competition raises quality as providers want to earn these rents
    - insurer competition tends to raise volume
    - but reduces incentives to raise quality
