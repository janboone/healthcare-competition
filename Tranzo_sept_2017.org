* Introduction

** The story

  - in the Netherlands we have introduced some competition elements in health care markets
  - but people tend to worry about this
  - some expect
    - over-treatment (this is how you earn money)
    - under-investment in quality (you cut costs)
  - this paper analyzes the effects of provider and insurer competition in health care markets on treatment volume and quality


** The setting

  - market with profit max. insurers and providers
  - regulator who can set (minimum) standards
  - imperfections:
    - not possible to contract treatment (patient's condition)
    - there is a non-contractible quality aspect
  - if quality fully contractible, regulator can set it
  - non-contr. quality one of the arguments for introducing competition
  - providers invest in quality to attract patients only if treatment is profitable
  - if treating patients is profitable, over-treatment becomes a risk
    - protocols are not perfect
  - how can this be resolved?

** The results

  - to implement welfare maximizing outcomes, competition is needed in insurer and health provider markets
    - purely public system without competition is not optimal
  - over-treatment and under-investment in quality happen when provider competition is "too low"
  - under-investment is addressed by increasing provider competition
  - over-treatment is addressed by decreasing insurer competition

** Literature

   - Porter and Teisberg (2006)
   - Gaynor et al. (2015)
   - Gal-Or (1997, 1999)
   - Douven et al. (2014)
   - Bijlsma et al. (2015)

* Model

** What is competition?

  - the advantage of having a model is that we can be precise about what "competition" means
  - probability $\theta$ that consumer makes a choice (insurer/provider) based on quality differences
  - is not the same as "profit"
  - also not the same as (low) concentration:
    - if one provider is better than another, competition increases concentration

** Competition is low

  - if there are high switching costs of changing insurer
  - everyone in Brabant chooses CZ
  - patients visit the closest provider, not the best one
    - e.g. because they do not know quality
    - don't understand quality information
    - choose on the wrong dimensions ("nurses are nice and food is great")


** How can competition be changed?

  - do not allow mergers, collusion
  - providers:
    - publish quality indicators, patient satisfaction reports
    - abolish agreements between specialists in (geographical) areas
    - UK government asked referring physicians to give patients five choices for a hospital
  - insurers:
    - websites that compare contracts
    - degree to which insurers' contracts are allowed to differ (product differentiation)
    - reduce reserve/solvency obligations (a health insurer is not a pension fund)

** What is non-contractible quality?

  - how doctors relate to patients
  - Porter and Teisberg: gather information of what treatments work under which circumstances exactly
    - whether the infrastructure for such data gathering is present is contractible
    - effort to do this carefully is not contractible

** Why is treatment not contractible?

  - there are protocols stating conditions for treatment
  - but there is always a grey area
  - we know that treatment reacts to financial incentives (e.g. fee-for-service) in this grey area

** Model simplifies a lot

  - to focus on the points above, we simplify on other dimensions:
   - two insurers and two providers
   - contracts are public and non-discriminating
   - focus on symmetric equilibria
   - no exclusive contracts
   - no adverse selection 


** Timing

    - *health procurement market*

        - insurers offer fee-for-service and capitation fees to providers
        - providers accept/reject
        - providers invest effort $e$ in quality

    - *health insurance market*

        - prob. $\theta_I$, there is compet.; $1-\theta_I$ consumer chooses
          insurer indep. from value offered
        - insurer sets premium
        - consumer decides from which insurer to buy

    - *health provider market*

        - prob. $1-\theta_P$ and $\theta_P$
        - competition in efforts
        - provider decides whether or not to treat $=>$ volume $v$
        - if patient is treated, provider receives fee-for-service


* Analysis

** Fee-for-service

  - assume that treatment cost for a patient increases with the treatment value
    - more complicated cases yield higher benefit and cost
    - over-treatment: $v-c(v) <0$ is treated
    - under-treatment: $v-c(v)>0$ is not treated
  - if insurer sets higher fee-for-service:
    - provider increases volume
    - provider profits increase, making it more attractive to capture patients by offering high quality
    - by increasing fee-for-service both volume and quality increase

** Quality

  - as provider competition increases --patients more sensitive to quality-- providers invest more in quality
  - in a public system without competition, no incentive to invest in (this type of) quality
  - for insurers there are quality spillover effects:
    - stimulate quality by increasing fee-for-service
    - as quality is not contractible, it is not excludable
    - your competitor benefits from increased quality as well
    - competing insurers tend to under-invest in quality

** Volume

  - as insurer competition increases:
    - "production" (treatment volume) increases via higher fee-for-service
    - insurers suffer more from quality spillover effects and tend to invest less in quality (lower fee-for-service)

** Competition

#+REVEAL: split


- low $\theta_P$ leads to over-treatment and under-investment
  - when $\theta_P$ is low, providers under-invest even from the point of view of insurers
  - insurers increase treatment beyond efficiency to stimulate quality: over-treatment
  - but insurers do not implement welfare max. quality
- this is the outcome some people fear in a health care *market*
- but it is due to insufficient competition

#+REVEAL: split

- high $\theta_P$, leads to high quality
  - welfare max. quality, is over-investment from the insurers point of view (due to spillovers)
  - hence insurers tend to reduce quality by lowering the fee-for-service
  - make competing for patients less profitable for providers
  - this tends to lead to under-treatment



* Conclusion

** Insights

    - think of provider rents/profits as caused by asymmetric information about patient type
    - provider competition raises quality as providers want to earn these rents
    - insurer competition tends to raise volume (competition leads to higher production)
    - but reduces incentives to raise quality (spillover effects)

** Policy implications

- if you believe we currently have over-treatment and under-investment in quality:
  - increase provider competition to stimulate quality efforts
    - e.g. by providing more quality information to patients
  - reduce insurer competition to reduce "output"
    - e.g. by allowing insurers to differentiate their products more
