* Introduction

** The story

  - in the Netherlands we have introduced some competition elements in health care markets
  - but people tend to worry about this
  - some expect
    - over-treatment (this is how you earn money)
    - under-investment in quality (you cut costs)
  - this paper analyzes the effects of provider and insurer competition in health care markets on treatment volume and quality


** The setting

  - market with profit max. insurers and providers
  - regulator who can set minimum standards
  - imperfections:
    - not possible to contract treatment (patient's condition)
    - there is a non-contractible quality aspect
  - if quality fully contractible, regulator can set it
  - non-contr. quality one of the arguments for introducing competition
  - providers invest in quality to attract patients only if treatment is profitable
  - if treating patients is profitable, over-treatment becomes a risk
  - how can this be resolved?

** The results

  - 


* Model

** What is competition?

  - the advantage of having a model is that we can be precise about what "competition" means
  - probability that consumer makes a choice (insurer/provider) based on quality differences
  - is not the same as "profit"
  - also not the same as (low) concentration:
    - if one provider is better than another, competition increases concentration

** Competition is low

  - if there are high switching costs of changing insurer
  - everyone in Brabant chooses CZ
  - patients visit the closest provider, not the best one
  - 


** How can competition be changed?

  - do not allow mergers, collusion
  - providers:
    - publish quality indicators, patient satisfaction reports
    - abolish agreements between specialists in (geographical) areas
    - UK government asked referring physicians to give patients five choices for a hospital
  - insurers:
    - websites that compare contracts
    - reduce reserve obligations (a health insurer is not a pension fund)

** What is non-contractible quality?

  - how doctors relate to patients
  - 

** Why is treatment not contractible?

  - protocols

** Simplify a lot

  - two insurers and two providers
  - contracts are public and non-discriminating
  - focus on symmetric equilibria
  - no exclusive contracts
  - no adverse selection 


** Timing

    - health procurement market

        - insurers offer fee-for-service, capitation fees to providers
        - providers accept/reject
        - providers invest effort $e$ in quality

    - health insurance market

        - prob. $\theta_I$, there is compet.; $1-\theta_I$ consumer chooses
          insurer indep. from value offered
        - insurer sets premium
        - consumer decides from which insurer to buy

    - health provider market

        - prob. $1-\theta_P$ and $\theta_P$
        - competition in efforts
        - provider decides whether or not to treat $=>$ volume $v$
        - if patient is treated, provider receives fee-for-service


** Literature

   - Porter and Teisberg (2006)
   - Gaynor et al. (2015)
   - Gal-Or (1997, 1999)
   - Douven et al. (2014)
   - Bijlsma et al. (2015)


* Results


** Fee-for-service

  - if insurer sets higher fee-for-service:
    - provider increases volume
    - provider profits increase, making it more attractive to capture patients by offering high quality
    - by increasing fee-for-service both volume and quality increase

** Quality

  - as provider competition increases --patients more sensitive to quality-- providers invest more in quality
  - in a public system without competition, no incentive to invest in quality
  - for insurers there are quality spillover effects:
    - stimulate quality by increasing fee-for-service
    - as quality is not contractible, it is not excludable
    - competing insurers invest less in quality

** Volume

  - as insurer competition increases:
    - "production" (treatment volume) increases
    - 

** Competition

#+REVEAL: split


    - "monopolist" captures whole insurance surplus and induces efficient
      treatment
    - competition tends to increase "production"


** Competition

    - suppose we have $\theta^*_{P,I}$ such that we are in first best

        - then a reduction in $R^*$ requires:
        - more intense provider competition (to keep up $e$)
        - more intense insurer competition to balance incentives for
          over-treatment and under-investment

    - suppose we have over-treatment and under-investment, then (under some conditions):

        - increase in $\theta_P$ increases welfare: quality becomes more
          responsive to volume
        - decrease in $\theta_I$ increases welfare: reduces volume

* Conclusion

** Policy implications

    - think of provider rents as caused by asymmetric information
    - provider competition raises quality as providers want to earn these rents
    - insurer competition tends to raise volume
    - but reduces incentives to raise quality
